    <h5>Review on Timi Omoyeni’s</h5>
    <h3><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/differences-static-generated-sites-server-side-rendered-apps/">Differences Between Static Generated Sites And Server-Side Rendered Apps</a></h3>

    <p>For growing and fledged web developers alike, Timi’s comparison between statically generated websites and server-side generated websites makes for a great overview on the two options when it comes to serving webpages. Although Timi himself calls it a tutorial, the post is more of a balance between conceptualizing for each methods and technical options for each, making this a hybrid of informative and instructional writing.</p>
    
    <p>For context, the post can be outlined by definitions, ideal use cases, listed pros and cons, and pairs of starter overviews for popular options. Depending on the section and content, Timi aptly uses formatting, text markdown, and images to categorize his information – regular text styling for prose, a code block markdown for shell commands/code snippets, and images to demonstrate expected results. </p>

    <p>As Timi writes to inform, I found his writing to be unbiased, fair, and straightforward for both options. His statements on rendering are clear and un-opinionated when he lists the costs and benefits of each option. His use of bullet pointed lists for the pros and cons of each end makes the content clear, concise, and easy to follow for developers. As for a nuanced criticism, I found it strange that there was no direct connection back to his introduction, where he lists the types of applications that are built with JavaScript. Although he lists costs and benefits, I did not find the lists sufficient for answering the problems that static and server side rendering solve.</p>

    <p>As Timi writes to guide, I found his tooling overviews to be incremental and linear. For each library (Gatsby, Vuepress, Next.js, Nuxt.js), his guides follow the typical developer/author documentation styles – markdown cells for anything code related, images, and short phrases. For each tool, I found it nice to have a glimpse into the syntax and inspirations behind each library. Although the guides accomplished their purposes, I found that there was a lack of depth and extensibility for each. As examples, they did not seem to share any extendable or long term insights and probably could have been substituted for any other generic starter guide.</p>

    <p>In a matter of opinion, I believe that the hybrid approach of being informative and making coding guides in the same post would have been more effective if done separately. If for a separation of concerns, I would have appreciated linked posts that went into more technical detail on each subject. Rather than just a definition, I believe developers would gain more from learning how each rendering process works, and how they may derive the listed costs and benefits. Rather than just a quick guide, there would be more to gain if guides were separate, annotated, and extensible. Although his writing gave the subject, it lacked the details on how/why each option worked, giving only a shallow sense for page rendering to developers.</p>

    <p>To qualify though, my sense of unfulfilled, technical curiosity is no surprise. Posts found on developer communities are often too light for any long term, practical application. Like most others, Timi’s post is more effective for sharing possibilities. </p>
