    <h1>Behind the Rhetoric</h1>

    <p>This page serves as an analysis of the rhetoric embedded within my portfolio website, which will include considerations on the rhetorical appeals, audience, structure, format, and motifs that went into the decision making and technical execution behind the screen.</p>

    <h3>Purpose for the Audience</h3>

    <p>It is the year of 2020, which roughly marks the second decade of stressful hiring practices for software developers. Assuming minimal error on the hiring and recruitment end, the standing trend in reviewing applicants for an entry level role is to move forward with the best matches by skills and experience via automated or manual keyword searches. That, as the first phase of at least three. As an unfortunate side effect, recruiters meet the supply of applications with a glance per submission. If the recruiter cannot quickly find a particular skill, the applicant does not have the skill.</p>
  
    <p>Literally speaking, this website was made for me. It is an accessible location whose subject is me. However, from a rhetorical standpoint, this site is a place for employers, peers, and opportunities. Thus, the contents of the page are presented with its audience in mind. Information presented in text are restricted to short phrases or gist, related images are placed in series, and elements are clearly spaced such that all content is made visible. The stacked layout of the page is designed for simplicity and quick reading, and yet does not neglect the design choices such as shadows, lines, color, and interactions. The website is planned such that visitors may quickly skim for what they want, while still offering room for exploration if they choose to stay and admire.</p>
  
    <h3>Appeals</h3>

    <p>In a way, my website accomplishes the main aim of a resume, but with added personality. I list my core qualifications and hard skills, relevant project experiences, and provide methods of contact. At the same time, my website will never be an alternative to my resume because it is simply not a document I can formally submit to prospective employers. Instead, my website reworks the traditional ethos of a formal resume towards persuading the important visitors to reach out and otherwise being a cherry-on-top for job applications. The personality, which comes from phrases in the header and connect sections, brings a slight pathos that would never pass on a traditional resume. As the purpose of this website does not require any form of statistics, evidence, or charts, there are no elements that intentionally appeal to logic. Similar to cover letters, this website is more of an extension to any application profile I create when applying for opportunities, rather than the core.</p>
  
    <p>The website is mostly a single, long web page that has the main sections in order or:</p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>Nav Bar, Header</li>
      <li>Skills</li>
      <li>Projects</li>
      <li>Connect, Footer</li>
      <li>Relevant links (Reads)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Additionally, there are links to this rhetoric page and my review of Timi Omoyeni’s article, “Differences Between Static Generated Sites And Server-Side Rendered Apps.” These pages are separated because they did not contribute to the purpose of the landing page, and thus would have been distracting.</p>

    <p>Each section was built with the goal of being brief and to the point, but may differ in how they appear. Every decision was intentional and will be discussed below. </p>

    <h3>Header</h3>

    <p>The header is the intended entry point to my website. In it, I quickly introduce myself using a photo and a list of things I do. My “This is me,” title is a first person greeting to my visitors – I skip salutations and jump directly to the things I do. Completing the title is a phrase, which cycles uniformly from a preset list of relevant activities. Paired with my static photo, I imply that a great deal of my work is done through a computer. The very top of the header holds a slim navigation bar offering bookmark links to the next sections of this page, links to my separated pages, and my name. The section itself takes on a minimal and easy-to-digest approach to kick start my profile. Further, the minimalism informs viewers that they are on a vertical scrolling web page – there are no confusions on how to navigate in this site. </p>

    <h3>Skills</h3>

    <p>This section is dedicated to my technical skill set. I split my competencies by placing priority and core skills on the top, while secondary and the nice-to-haves are located just below. Each competency is listed by logo and caption to give ease on skimming. Skill icons are strictly a monotone black to maintain the visual integrity of each icon and eliminate distracting and chaotic colors (Some colored logos consist of strokes that may be hard to see with color, a colored version of this section would have over 15 distinct color hues). In a regular viewing, it would be normal for a visitor to scroll in, pause shortly, and move on. </p>

    <h3>Projects</h3>

    <p>This section is dedicated to my project driven, technical experience. Here, I organize a collection of previous projects into a grid format. My projects are listed in a mixed order of technical complexity and most recent. Each item comes with the name of the project, an image of the project, and a short description. If the project is available online, I include a link so that viewers may visit the project or its repository. I’ve also included a current project to let visitors know that I am an active developer. This section functions as a quick snapshot of the types of projects I build outside of industry, which lets viewers know that I am always building out projects and open to diverse topics. As projects are ordered by complexity, visitors may observe my growth as a developer through these projects.  </p>
    
    <h3>Connect</h3>
    
    <p>This section is the call to action. In it, I briefly mention what I value as a developer and include links to my email, Github profile, and LinkedIn profile. The content here functions as an advertisement with ‘click to buy’ buttons. Since this is effectively the conclusion of my profile, I choose to end by mirroring the direct language of the header to maintain my tone as an assertive, to the point,  and active developer.  For convenience, each of the links open a separate tab or window so that visitors will not have to re-navigate to my site. At the base of the section is the footer, which only contains a copyright message to (minimally) protect my site’s assets and source code. </p>
    
    <h3>Links</h3>

    <p>This section demonstrates how I am up to date in the field. I list my top eight links to third party documentation, tech publishing, and utility websites that are popular within the developer community. Under each link, I give my own gist of each site and my personal usage of each. Similar to the previous section, each link opens on a separate tab or window so that visitors will not have to re-navigate back to my website. This section is listed under the formal footer because it is surplus information that gives readers an idea of the resources I frequently visit, but does not directly express any explicit qualification for important visitors.</p>
    
    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    
    <img src="media/accessibility.jpg" alt="Accessibility Image"/>

    <p>While my portfolio website is best viewed on large screens, I have applied a cascade of conditional layout specifications for each section depending on device and screen size to improve readability and maintain design/styling. In order of section, the changes are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>For smaller devices, the header section layout becomes centered.</li>
      <li>For smaller devices, the skills section widens and evens out.</li>
      <li>For mid-sized screens, the projects section widens and evens out.</li>
      <li>For smaller devices, the projects section condenses and scrolls horizontally.</li>
      <li>For smaller devices, the connect section becomes stacked and centered.</li>
      <li>For smaller devices, the links section becomes stacked.</li>
      <li>For smaller screens, some transformative transition animations are removed, as they are pointless without pointing devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These changes are accommodations that keep my site in a presentable state across any device and window size, giving every visitor a standardized experience. Further, the changes account for potential visual bugs and glitches that may occur under various devices, browsers, browser versions, and browser vendors. </p>

    <h3>Show, not tell</h3>

    <p>This website is the means to essay my qualifications as a modern and growing web developer in a multimedia format. The main goal of the portfolio is to cover my technical competencies, experience, and perspectives in prospecting for the next steps in my career. While directly conveying information is the most important aspect, there is a degree of subtle, technical functionality that works off the base design as visual and real-time evidence to my capabilities. Animations, external hyperlinks, style updates, etc. are alternatively and independently their own means of achieving the page’s purpose. </p>

    <h3>On Design Choices</h3>

    <p>First and foremost, I made minimalism and simplicity my priorities when conceptualizing the design. My decisions were made with the goal of omitting superfluous content so I could deliver strictly what my audience wanted. Because of the resulting tightness of my content, my intention was ultimately to unify my content as part of the design by layout. </p>

    <p>For my website’s color palette, I settled on designing around a monotone color scheme. My primary hue was a light yellow-orange. I found that this color humanized the layout of my website, bringing a more in-person and social effect more than any other hue. Though I do not consider it as part of the palette, I use a light blue color for external links to complement the primary hue and maintain a visual contrast. With this color scheme, I alternated section backgrounds such that sections with grayscale backgrounds contained formal information (skills, professional links, copyright) and sections with primary backgrounds contained items of more personal significance (projects, links). To this end, I also override some default browser styles to fit the website theme more (a slim, shady orange scroll bar, highlighted page elements are orange instead of blue, etc.). </p>

    <p>On typography, sans serif typefaces were the obvious choice. From the ideation, I had wanted to build a clean and modern experience for visitors. For all text, I used the fonts included in the page’s development frameworks and made sure the font stacks specified web safe fall back fonts. The text for the navigation bar was comparably lighter to stylishly de-emphasize itself form the main content. The main components used either bolded type for headings or regular types for information, links, and captions.</p>

    <p>On section transitions, I decided to play with lines. Rather than using a traditional stacked design, I decided to use diagonal lines instead of horizontal lines as section dividers. I found that this implementation gave a ‘leading lines’ effect as viewers scrolled through the site, which was a pleasant surprise. For instance, as viewers scroll from the projects to the connect section, the section transition leads viewers from a top right disposition to a bottom left, translating the focal point from my last listed project to my contact buttons; It doubled as a subtle easing support for reading, as my content is meant to be read from left to right, top to bottom.</p>

    <h3>Hosting, Domain, and some technicalities</h3>

    <p>My page is publicly accessible online through GitHub pages. Subsequently, access to my site is secure because Github pages is certified with a secure sockets layer, letting people visit my site under a secured transfer protocol. Although this mandates my site to be under the github.io subdomain, I’ve found that hosting portfolios in this manner is widely accepted and understandable in the developer community. The few notable drawbacks of hosting here were strict client side only code execution, the subdomain, lack of load balancing, and the plugin/command driven deployment process.  However, I believe that the benefits outweigh any cost, as the scope of the site will probably never require any components that would be restricted by Github’s hosting policies. Lastly, this means that the source code for this website is publicity accessible under my GitHub profile’s listed repositories – something I find as a nice touch if viewers want to see its implementation. Further technical details can be found under the project repository’s readme file.</p>
